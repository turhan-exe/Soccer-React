E2E Test Plan (Step 10)

Prereqs
- Firebase emulators running for Firestore, Functions, Storage and Realtime DB
- Functions config secrets set in emulator env if you test HTTP-auth endpoints:
  - orchestrate.secret (used by orchestrate19TRT)

Start emulators

  firebase emulators:start --only firestore,functions,storage,database,hosting

Seed minimal data

  # from repo root or src/functions
  cd src/functions
  PROJECT_ID=demo-osm-react node src/functions/scripts/seed.mjs M001

Happy path (lock -> start -> live -> finalize)

  # Ensure you export ORCH_SECRET matching functions:config:set orchestrate.secret
  # Windows PowerShell example:
  #   $env:ORCH_SECRET="YOUR_SECRET"
  #   $env:PROJECT_ID="demo-osm-react"

  npm run -w ./src/functions e2e:happy

What e2e:happy does
- Seeds league L-TR-1-2025a, teams T001/T002 and fixture M001 at today 19:00 TR
- Calls lockWindowSnapshot (idempotent) to create matchPlans/M001
- Calls orchestrate19TRT with bearer secret; sets fixture to running
- Pushes two live events to RTDB live/M001/events
- Uploads results JSON to Storage results/2025a/L-TR-1-2025a/M001.json to trigger onResultFinalize
- Verifies fixture becomes played and replayPath is set

Retry & Poison (watchdog)
- startMatch, ardından finalize gelmezse watchdog devreye girmesi için ayarlıdır.
- Varsayılan gecikme 20 dk (FINALIZE_WATCHDOG_DELAY_SEC). Emülatörde hızlandırmak için:

  WINDOWS PowerShell (örnek)
    $env:FINALIZE_WATCHDOG_DELAY_SEC="15"
    $env:FINALIZE_MAX_RETRIES="3"

- startMatch sonrası 15 sn içinde finalize gelmezse yeniden dispatch dener; 3. denemeden sonra:
  - fixtures status -> failed
  - failedJobs/{matchId}
  - Slack bildirimi (env/config gerektirir)

Manual helpers

  # Push two live events
  npm run -w ./src/functions push-live

  # Trigger finalize by uploading a sample results JSON
  npm run -w ./src/functions finalize:sample

Replay URL
- Use callable getReplay from the app to get a signed URL for the replayPath.
- When testing manually, Storage emulator exposes files at http://127.0.0.1:9199/v0/b/<bucket>/o/<path>

Security checks (rules)
- Firestore: writing to fixtures/matchPlans from client is denied
- RTDB: live/* write is denied for clients, read allowed for auth != null
- Storage: replays/* readable for auth users (json/json.gz), results/* not readable/writable by clients
